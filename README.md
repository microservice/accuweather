## Introduction

This project is an example implementation of the [Open Microservice Specification](https://openmicroservices.org), a standard originally created at [Storyscript](https://storyscript.io) for building highly-portable "microservices" that expose the events, actions, and APIs inside containerized software.

## Getting Started

The `oms` command-line interface allows you to interact with Open Microservices. If you're interested in creating an Open Microservice the CLI also helps validate, test, and debug your `oms.yml` implementation!

See the [oms-cli](https://github.com/microservices/oms) project to learn more!

### Installation

```
npm install -g @microservices/oms
```

## Usage

### Open Microservices CLI Usage

Once you have the [oms-cli](https://github.com/microservices/oms) installed, you can run any of the following commands from within this project's root directory:

#### Actions

##### forecast

> 
##### Action Arguments

| Argument Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|:------------- |:---- |:-------- |:--------|:----------- |
| location | `string` | `true` | None | The location to retrieve the current weather status (eg "Amsterdam Netherlands"  |
| API_KEY | `string` | `true` | None | Create an AccuWeather developer account here - https://developer.accuweather.com  |

``` shell
oms run forecast \ 
    -a location='*****' \ 
    -e API_KEY=$API_KEY
```

## Contributing
